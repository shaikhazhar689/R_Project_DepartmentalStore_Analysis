## Departmental Store Analysis
Welcome to my R programming departmental store analysis project! As a data analyst, I have meticulously crafted this portfolio project, 
utilizing various R libraries and packages, including ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, and ggcorrplot. By employing these powerful tools, I have
conducted extensive descriptive analysis, employing functions like filter, slicing, groupby, summarise, and mutate to generate new tables 
and extract valuable insights. Additionally, I have created compelling visualizations such as column plots, line plots, histograms, 
scatterplots, and circular plots, shedding light on essential aspects of the departmental store's performance during Covid19 Pandemic.
